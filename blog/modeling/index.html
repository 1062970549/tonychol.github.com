<h1 id="background">Background:</h1>

<p>To simplify our model, we need to elaborate a psychological concept: <strong>safety distance</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Safety distance</strong> means the distance in which people feel comfortable with the unfamiliar people. The safety distance comes from the so-called “protective area” of 0.93m2, which is defined by the American psychologist Jane Jacobs. </p>

<p><img src="http://d.pr/i/OHRF.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>What’s more,we also define the construction area into three major categories: </p>

<ul>
  <li>business hall area</li>
  <li>aisles area</li>
  <li>storage area</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>But the only area we are interested in is the area for people’s activity(except for the bathroom, information desk, counter, etc.), which we call the “real area”.</strong></p>

<p>In this case, storage area are excluded. The “real area”  share 65% of its whole business hall area.</p>

<h1 id="abstract">Abstract</h1>
<p>We formulate two models to establish a standard for the “lawful capacity” in a giving room.</p>

<p>We construct Model A to make the calculation of the capacity simpler and faster by transforming the whole problem into a interesting problem of counting the small circles in a much bigger one, while every small circle represents every individual in the room and the huge circle embracing the small circles means the giving room.</p>

<p>However, the capacity in safe environment is not enough. We need to consider the specific effect from emergency and danger, such as the car accident. Therefore, we build the Model B to take the emergency into account.
In Model B, we first ignore the extremely devastating disaster such as hurricane, tsunami and earthquake, and we only talk about the “generic emergency”, such as the fire hazard. In this case, we define the areas of the building into three part: business hall area, aisles area and storage area.  According to our research, we could also define the ‘real area’, which represents the area for people to stay and stroll. And it is known that the “real area” covers sixty-five percentage of the business hall area. So we can obtain the total quantity of people of the whole building and we can lead to a special coefficient, called “evacuation coefficient”, which can help us to work out the the number of people escaping from the danger.</p>

<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>We present two models to solve the “lawful capacity” problem, which is to establish a standard to determine the number of the people to evacuate a giving room. <br />
In Model A, considering it is a complex project to completely solve the problem, we simplified the problem and to consider the buildings with square multi-storey construction. Meanwhile, we find out that both the rate of all the people inside the building at different times in a day and the number of the people on different storeys obeys the <strong>normal distribution</strong>. We transformed our square multi-storey model into a spherical multi-storey model. And to solve the spherical model, we need to elaborate a psychological concept proposed by the American psychologist Jane Jacobs: <strong>safety distance</strong>, which implies a circular range for a people from being bothered by strangers. And we defined the radius of the circular range as the “safety distance”. In this case, we assume the so-called “capacity” as the maximum amount of the circles, with the radius of <strong>safety distance</strong>, which can be filled in the enormous spherical building.</p>

<p><img src="http://d.pr/i/Cpdw.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>In Model A, we collected some data from a shopping hall and worked out a result ,which was nearly the same with the practical information. What has amazed us is that we have made up a simple but reasonable model.</p>

<p>On account of what we have known, we should put forward a criteria not only considering the lawful capacity in case of the safety but also thinking about some new ways to solve the problem in the emergency,which forces everyone to flee from the building. <strong>That’s why we need to build the Model B.</strong>   Originally, we ruled out some disasters, which are devastating so that people can hardly survive from, like hurricane, tsunami and earthquake. After excluding the those destructive disasters, we choose to do the modeling in the emergency of fire, which we have defined as the “generic emergency”, and regard the evacuation of persons as the criteria of “lawful capacity”. <br />
In the course of our research, we have read a lot and were surprised to find out that many people have done the research of these situation. To establish the measure, we divided the area of the building into three part: business hall area, aisles area and storage area. We defined a concept called ‘real area’ among them, which represents the area for people to stay and stroll. According to our research, we could define the ‘real area’, where there is 0.74 customer and 0.10 waiter in each square meter,and it covers sixty-five percentage of the business hall area. So we can obtain the total quantity of people of the whole building and we can lead to a kind of coefficient, called “evacuation coefficient”, which help us to work out the number of people escaping from the danger. In conclusion, we can regard the number of evacuation as the lawful capacity, which is helpful for local government to set the criteria for indoor places.</p>

<p>At the end of the basic model, we proposed four kinds of difference among the four architectures with two special conditions</p>

<ul>
  <li>safety distance</li>
  <li>ratio of the real area </li>
  <li>evacuation coefficient</li>
  <li>personal density. </li>
</ul>

<p>The cafeteria has some movable furnitures and its customers should enjoy a safety distance compared with those in the lecture hall or gymnastic, so we consider the cafeteria is similar to model A. Due to fact that the seats’ arrangement depends on the architecture of the lecture hall and gym, it’s too hard to work out the capacity of them. So we tried to apply the solution of model B to solve the problem, and it works well finally! When occuring to the swimming pool and the playground of the gymnastic, we thought about many national physical standards so that we get the data of each people should take up the quantity of the sports area and then we can work out the number of people that the swimming pool or playground can contain.</p>
